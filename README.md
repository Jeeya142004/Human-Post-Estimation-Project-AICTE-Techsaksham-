# Human Pose Estimation using Machine Learning

**Human Pose Estimation (HPE)** is a crucial area within computer vision and machine learning that focuses on detecting and estimating the pose of human bodies in static images or video sequences. The goal of HPE is to accurately analyze the spatial positions of key body joints or landmarks, effectively capturing the posture and orientation of individuals.
